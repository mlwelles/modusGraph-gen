// Package movies anchors the //go:generate directive for the wrapper-parent
// layout: schema files live in ./schema/, and modusgraph-gen emits wrappers
// here (the parent of schema/). Running `go generate ./...` from this
// directory passes -entities to exercise both the schema-side output (the
// generated aggregate Client whose fields are *typed.Client[T], plus the
// marker_gen.go file emitted into schema/) and the generated wrapper/entity
// layer (wrapper entity types that embed typed.Wrapper[S], per-entity wrapper
// clients that compose over *typed.Client, and fluent wrapper queries over
// *typed.Query). The -entities flag is required because the wrapper layer is
// opt-in (off by default); the cross-package e2e tests in unwrap_e2e_test.go
// import the movies wrapper package and call movies.WrapStudio. The wrapper
// layer composes over the handwritten typed package — it does not stack on
// per-entity schema clients (those no longer exist). See
// docs/specs/2026-05-20-typed-generic-client-design.md for the current design.
// Flag and path-resolution rules are covered in
// docs/specs/2026-05-18-public-wrapper-types-design.md.
//
// -no-cli is passed because the generated CLI imports github.com/alecthomas/kong,
// which is not (and should not be) a dependency of the modusgraph module itself.
// Adding kong to go.mod would cause `go mod tidy` to strip it, since nothing in
// the compiled tree uses it. This fixture exists to exercise the schema + wrapper
// layers; the cross-package e2e tests (unwrap_e2e_test.go) import the wrapper
// package directly and do not need a CLI. CLI generation correctness is covered
// by TestGenerate_CLIImportsSchemaByFullPath in the generator package.
